## Project Overview
Our dataset that we used to train our model is from UC Irvine and contained 8,124 rows of data. This looked at many different features of mushrooms, including cap shape, cap surface, cap color, bruises, odor, gill-attachement, gill spacing, gill size, gill color, stalk shape, stalk root, stalk surfaces above and below ring, veil types, veil colors, ring numbers, ring types, spore print colors, population, and habitat. 

## Steps  

## Conclusion
We tested three models including Kneighbors, Random Forest, and Decision Tree. All three models were able to predict which mushrooms were edible or posionous based on the various features listed above at 99% to 100% accuracy. The most important features overall in determining if a mushroom was edible or poisonous were odor, gill size, bruises, texture of stalk surface, and spore color.
